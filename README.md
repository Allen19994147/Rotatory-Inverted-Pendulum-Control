# Rotatory-Inverted-Pendulum-Control

In this task, a controller is designed to stablize a rotatory inverted pendulum.
The main program is RIP_Control_Final.cpp, while lqr_continuous.m and lqr_digital.m are controller designs in continuous and digital domains.
Besides, A digital filter to estimate the velocities of the system based on positions is designed in arm_speed_digital_filter.m
