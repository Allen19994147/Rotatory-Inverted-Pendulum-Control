# Rotatory-Inverted-Pendulum-Control

In this task, a controller is designed to stablize a rotatory inverted pendulum.

The main program is RIP_Control_Final.cpp, while lqr_continuous.m and lqr_digital.m are controller designed in continuous and digital domains.
Besides, a digital filter to estimate the angular velocities of the system based on the angular positions is designed in arm_speed_digital_filter.m
